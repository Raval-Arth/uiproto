An immediate audience of one's peers provides immediate incentives to programmers to keep their code clear and comprehensible, as well as functional.",
    "You might not think that programmers are artists, but programming is an extremely creative profession. It's logic-based creativity.",
    "JavaScript is the only language that I'm aware of that people feel they don't need to learn before they start using it.",
    "Be humble, communicate clearly, and respect others. It costs nothing to be kind, but the impact is priceless.",
    "Telling a programmer there's already a library to do X is like telling a songwriter there's already a song about love.",
    "Should array indices start at 0 or 1? My compromise of 0.5 was rejected without, I thought, proper consideration.",
    "The purpose of abstraction is not to be vague, but to create a new semantic level in which one can be absolutely precise.",
    "There certainly will be job disruption. Because what's going to happen is robots will be able to do everything better than us.",
    "Sometimes, the elegant implementation is a function. Not a method. Not a class. Not a framework. Just a function.",
    "Artificial intelligence is the science of making machines do things that would require intelligence if done by men.",
    "I just had to take the hypertext idea and connect it to the TCP and DNS ideas and \u2014 ta-da!\u2014 the World Wide Web.",
    "A computational process is indeed much like a sorcerer's idea of a spirit. It cannot be seen or touched. It is not composed of matter at all. However, it is very real. It can perform intellectual work. It can answer questions. It can affect the world by disbursing money at a bank or by controlling a robot arm in a factory.",
    "One must assume that there will be lots of bugs, and plan an orderly procedure for snaking them out.",
    "To achieve conceptual integrity, a design must proceed from one mind or a small group of agreeing minds.",
    "The very best technology never has as much impact as girlfriend or boyfriend trouble.",
    "Maintenance cost is strongly affected by the number of users. More users find more bugs.",
    "Most errors are introduced during requirements specification!",
    "Programming is similar to a game of golf. The point is not getting the ball in the hole but how many strokes it takes.",
    "A number of studies have shown testing not very effective at finding bugs.",
    "The key to keeping software costs down is to write code that is easily modified.",
    "The notions of correctness in mathematics and programs are different. A mathematical model must be consistent; it need not match reality (be correct), and it need not be complete (in the formal sense). A program model must be consistent; it must match reality; and it must be complete (in the sense that it reacts gracefully to all inputs).",
    "Programming is at least as difficult as developing a mathematical theory.",
    "In 1971 when I joined the staff of the MIT Artificial Intelligence lab, all of us who helped develop the operating system software, we called ourselves hackers. We were not breaking any laws, at least not in doing the hacking we were paid to do. We were developing software and we were having fun. Hacking refers to the spirit of fun in which we were developing software.",
    "By June 1949 people had begun to realize that it was not so easy to get programs right as at one time appeared.",
    "Everything should be made as simple as possible. But to do that you have to master complexity.",
    "If I had followed my heart instead of advice, dBASE would be much closer to perfection today.",
    "Programming is a little bit like the army. Now that I'm out, it's neat to have had the experience.",
    "I don't like using any tools or programs I didn't write myself or that I don't have some control over.",
    "If you cannot explain a program to yourself, the chance of the\ncomputer getting it right is pretty small.",
    "I don't comment on the code itself because I feel that properly written code is very much self-documented.",
    "When a program is clean and neat, nicely structured, and consistent, it can be beautiful.",
    "JavaScript, purely by accident, has become the most popular programming language in the world.",
    "Software is a discipline of detail, and that is a deep, horrendous fundamental problem with software.",
